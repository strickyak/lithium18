# lithium18
Lithium 2018 Genetic Programming experiment (golang)

Demo:

    $ go run main.go -c 2000 -o 30 -s 3000 -goal count

Warning: Will consume all CPU and runs forever (so hit ^C).

(* A previous experiment from 2006 was (mostly) in C++ here:
[http://yak.net/repos/lithium/]()
but that is an ancient mess so don't even go there. *)
